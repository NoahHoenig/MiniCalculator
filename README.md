My Unit tests are testing the multiply, divide, and calculate function of my MiniCalculator.  
My unit tests for multiply test a positive int times a positive int

                                      a negative int times a positive int
My unit tests for divde test a positive int divide a positive int
                                      a zero int divide a positive int
                                      a negative int divide a positive int
My unit tests for calculate test if you input a number that number is outputted.
